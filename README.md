# Android_Ideas
 learning new android development concepts is sometimes challenging but it improves you.i seek out online material related to what i think is relevant to know as far as app development is concerned, implement them practically encountering challenges and obstacles in the process that i eventually solve. I try to think through why those challenges occur and when i cannot find a solution, i calm down and comeup with a good question that i google. eventually i find a solution through repeating this process. What i learn in the process i document here in order of occurence so that atleast one person out there can spend less time googling.
