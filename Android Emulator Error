Emulator: emulator: ERROR: This AVD's configuration is missing a kernel file! Please ensure the file "kernel-qemu" is in the same location as your system image.

If your Emulator fails with the above error, here is what you do.
Browse to the location of your sdk, usually c/user/useaccount/Appdata/local/Android/sdk
Open the system images subfolder and browse the subsequent folders till you find kernel-qemu
Copy it
Navigate backwards in the folder structure till you back to add-ons which is the first thing in the sdk folder.
Open addon-google_apis-google-18 within that folder(or whatever the corresponding one is for you)
Open images and paste it the emulator folder within that. restart android studio, hope it works, worked for me.
